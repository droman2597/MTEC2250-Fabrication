79% Work Clock
The clock is a constant reminder that the wage gap is a very present aspect of working life in America. It’s more informative than practical. It’s a nice way of telling us that women are still fighting for equal pay. I like that the clock chimes once 79% of the workday is over depending on women of color. 


I.E.D (Improvised Empathetic Device)
This device updates the personal details and numbers of slain US soldiers. The LCD readout displays the soldiers name, rank, cause of death, and location and then triggers an electric solenoid to drive a needle into the wearer’s arm, drawing blood and immediate attention to the reality that a soldier has just died in the Iraq war. This is very good tech because it is a constant reminder that there will always be casualties in war and that we must pay attention to whatever’s happening. Not a fan of the needle though, maybe a shock would be ok.


Transparency Grenade 
The grenade lets users leak information from any closed-door meetings by just pulling the pin.  The grenade includes a computer with a microphone and powerful wireless antenna that captures network traffic and audio in a location and anonymously streams it to an external server that mines it for information – including e-mail excerpts, web pages, images and voice. The server then uploads that data to a public website and positions it on a map. I love the way the tech looks, and I really like the concept and its good because we can find out of companies are meeting up about.
